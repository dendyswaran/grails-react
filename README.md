# Grails meets React!
Going Isomorphic with Grails and React

A very simple usage of react's server side rendering in grails (2.4.4). 

Here is the project summary:
1. Using Java 8 Nashorn for the javascript engine
2. Using balsamiq's jsx asset pipeline to support jsx extension (https://github.com/balsamiq/jsx-grails-asset-pipeline).
